This gem provides jQuery-UI bootstrap theme integration.

# Install

  gem 'jquery-ui-bootstrap-rails'


# Use

In your application.css manifest:

  *= require bootstrap

In your application.js manifest:

  //= require bootstrap

Since this gem depends on jQuery-UI to work, it is enabled by default. No need to do so manually, yay!
